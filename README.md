# Mirror-Sync

A senior design project for MNSU, Mankato where we are trying to build a Smart Mirror controlled by the website from scratch. The idea behind this project was to make a syncrhonized smart mirror controlled by the website so non-coders can have the luxury to easily manage their layouts and data. We call our product Mirror-Sync because its not just a Smart Mirror, but a Smartly Synced Mirror.
To build this project we have used python's tkinter library to code for the GUI and used CSS, HTML and DjangoFramework to build the website. Our database is made using PostreSQL and we wanted everyone to access it so we hosted it on railway.
